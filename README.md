# Testing Grounds
---
This repository houses my game project for a first person survival type game Testing Grounds. I started the creation of this game during my course at Udemy - "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games", found [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubDiscount), led by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi. This is not yet a full-fledged game.

## Technical information
The game has been created with UnrealEngine 4.15.1 and VisualStudio 2015. It is written in C++ and scripted with blueprints.

## The Game
The game is played from a first person perspective. The goal of the game is for the player to cross a field with objects(hiding spots) hiding from patrolling NPCs(enemies) and reach the other field behind a green transparent wall undetected. The fields are procedurally generated and the player has to overcome as many fields as he can.
